This site it's just a project to simulate an eCommerce for clothes. starting the development from a responsive version to the web version.
For now, I'm creating just the login page. With this project, I'm learning to use CSS, javascript, Git and islinter/CSSLinter. 
The backend will have a  database for login, register e redefine password (IN PHP OR PYTHON).
